# 🧱 Clean Architecture Notes

This repository contains comprehensive notes on **Clean Architecture**, inspired by the principles popularized by *Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)*.  
It explains how to design **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **testable** software systems that remain flexible as they grow.

## 📖 Overview

The notes cover key Clean Architecture principles and practical implementations, including:

- **Core Concepts**
  - The Dependency Rule  
  - The four architectural layers: Entities, Use Cases, Interface Adapters, Frameworks & Drivers

- **Advanced Topics**
  - Naming conventions for private variables  
  - Separation of mapping profiles  
  - Returning Entities vs DTOs  
  - Dependency Injection (DI) strategies for small, medium, and large applications

  - Supporting folders like `config/`, `shared/`, and `tests/`

- **Conclusion**
  - Best practices for building robust applications  
  - Recommendations for further learning and architecture mastery
